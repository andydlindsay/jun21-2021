### To Do
- [x] "Rails Week" Conversation
- [x] MVC Review
- [x] Rails Libraries
- [x] Quickly build simple Rails app
- [x] Nested Resources
- [ ] Scaffold generator

### Rails Week Convo
* like the way Ruby looks (very clean)
* automation of Rails (so many steps) maybe too auto-magical?
* AR is great!
* liked the videos from @KV
* similarities between languages
* really liked the small touches (?, !, hungarian notation)

### MVC
* Model = database interaction layer
* View = UI, erb
* Controller = connects the model with the view
* Routing = directs incoming requests (MVCR)

### Rails Libraries
* Active Record => querying the database, migrations, seeding
* Action View => templating engine, helpers (form_for, link_to)
* Action Controller => controllers
* Action Dispatch => dispatcher, communicates between router and the controller
* Action Cable => web sockets for Rails
